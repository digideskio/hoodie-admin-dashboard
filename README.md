# Pocket rebuild

Static HTML for now. Currently includes a fluid version of gridster.js (check out https://github.com/espy/gridster.js/blob/master/README.md to see how that works).

Use `$ grunt watch` to auto-compile any changed files (no livereload yet).

Build CSS with `$ grunt compass`
Build JS with `$ grunt browserify`
Build everything with `$ grunt build`

Enjoy!
